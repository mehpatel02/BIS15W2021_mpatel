# Mehal Patel's BIS 15L Repository
Hello! I am a beginner in R! This repository has my work from the UC Davis course: Data Science for Biologists. I am interested in learning about R so that I can apply it to data analysis related to Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing, and ChIP-seq. I plan to use the skills I learn to provide a foundation to build on even more!
